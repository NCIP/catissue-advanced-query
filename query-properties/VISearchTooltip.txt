The search text might contain a special character.

Try one of the following options:
	- Check if your search text has any of the following special characters:
	  # @ ! ~ $ % ^ & * ( ) [ ] { } - _ + = / \ , ' : ; | ? `, and so on.
	  If any of the special character is there use one of the following option:
	  1. Delete the special character.
	  2. If you typed 'Glucose^' or 'Glucose!' type 'Glucose^ 75g' or 'Glucose'. It means if your search text has 'any word followed by special character' then try using 'any word followed by special character followed by any word'.
	  3. Your search text should not start with the special character. For example, '@Glucose' is invalid search text.
	  4. Avoid using '[',']','(' and ')' in search text.
