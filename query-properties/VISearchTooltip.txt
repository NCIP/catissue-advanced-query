The search criteria might contain a special character. 

Check if your search criteria has any of the following special characters: 
		  # @ ! ~ $ % ^ & * ( ) [ ] { } - _ + = / \ , ' : ; | ? ` and so on.

If yes, try one of the following options:
	  1. Delete the special character in your search criteria.
	  2. Type 'Glucose^ 75g' or 'Glucose' instead of '^Glucose' or 'Glucose@'. It means, do not begin or end a search criteria with a special character. 
	  3. Do not use [, ], (, and ) in the search criteria.
